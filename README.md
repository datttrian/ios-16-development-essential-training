Looking to pursue a career in iOS development? Or do you have a brand or product that could use its own app? In this course, Todd Perkins gets you started down the path of iOS development, giving you the knowledge to help you create your own apps, even if you’re starting out with zero iOS experience. Todd teaches you the fundamentals of XCode, Apple's official tool for developing iOS applications. He shows you how to build the UI, from understanding the basics of iOS UI with Interface Builder, to layout and preview modes, as well as responsive UI and more advanced UI objects. He also delves into app architecture—the iOS lifecycle, events, and tasks. Along the way, test your knowledge with some challenges and compare your work to Todd’s solutions.
